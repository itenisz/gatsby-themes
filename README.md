# Gatsby Themes by @itenisz

This project is a collection of packages as a [monorepo](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/monorepos/) managed with [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/).

## Warning

:warning: **This repo is very unstable and likely to change.**

Use at your own risk :ghost:

The packages are still in heavy development, If I found better solution to any part of this project, I may change it completely.

## The goal of this project

I started this to learn to work with the newest technologies and maintain high quality of coding standards. I especially wanted to work with multilingual environment, because that's not an easy task to do. Try it for yourself and you will see why. Before start, I was unable to find any other example which is working with mdx, theme-ui and i18n and the topic of i18n solutions was very confusing with many different approaches.

So I made my own solution, based on the official Gatsby i18n example, without using any outside i18n libraries, only with GraphQL queries (In the future I may create versions with the great i18n libraries like react-intl or i18next). On the top of that, I decided to use Typescript, because it seems Typescript provides a lot of help to write a better code. For the Design System I use Theme-UI which I think is the best, and that's the future of frontend solutions in React and Gatsby. (Gatsby has official support to Theme-ui and they create a theme dev team to provide more higher level components in the future)

## Special Thanks to some great developers

They motivated me and showed a great way, how to handle development processes.

- Thanks to **Brent Jackson** ([@jxnblk](https://jxnblk.com/)) the creator of Theme-ui, who is one of the greatest developers on this planet, I learned from him a lot about design principles. His Theme-ui is just amazing and reforms the whole approach to designing. I recommend to read his [blog](https://jxnblk.com/blog).

- Thanks to **LekoArts** ([@LekoArts](https://www.lekoarts.de/)) creator of many high quality open source Gatsby Themes, and the original official Gatsby i18n example. He helps a lot in dev community on different forums and platforms. I learned a general approach to i18n from him, and about gatsby themes and his work encouraged me to use Typescript.

- Thanks to **Jason Lengstorf** ([@jlengstorf](https://lengstorf.com/)) who is a really great guy, a great speaker, working a lot for dev community and constantly helping others. I learned from him a more open minded attitude to handle development and he shows great balance to maintain a healthier developer life.

- Thanks to **Kristóf Poduszló** ([@kripod](https://github.com/kripod/)) who is following high quality coding standards as a computer engineer, I learned from him the importance of strict eslint and a new aproach to handle frontend with Design Systems like Rebass (by Brent Jackson).
